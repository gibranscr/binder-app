      "Benzene is a colorless liquid at room temperature. Is boiling point. Is 82 degrees celsius. It's found naturally in crude oil smells a little like petrol. On an atomic level benzene is made up of six carbon.. Covalently bonded in a ring. Each carbon is also covalently bonded to one hydrogen. This makes it a hydrocarbon. Carbon usually forms for single covalent bonds and these cabins at the moment sammy have three. The molecule not just something very special. The woman tied election for me carbon becomes. Conjugated into the ring. This means they have free movement around all six carbons and this gives benzene the property of. Aromaticity. Aromaticity simplement nice-smelling scientifically. There are various ways of showing benzene's aromaticity like these for example. The most calm by you'll see benzene drawn in a textbook is like this. This is done only for convenience. Can be dangerous isaac's carcinogenic. That is known to cause cancer in sufficient doses. The magic. When will i be able to join benzene ring. The other organic molecules. Some of the most important and useful drugs are made this way. Example is aspirin. One of the most famous painkillers in the world. The important thing to remember here is it's almost impossible to do an addition reaction on benzene. This destroys the aromaticity of the ring a process which need a lot of energy. What joseph. Is substitution reactions. Why one of the protons it kicked out of the compounds by another species we takes its place on the molecule keeps his iron deficiency. This can happen more than once and the benzene is said to be mono die or trisubstituted. What sort of chemical species will we need to cause a substitution reaction to happen. Remember the anthem in the benzene being attacked is one of the coffins and these coffins have lots of electrons moving around them. Pause the video and have a thing. Them redeem. Beyonce's we will need an electrophile something that will be attracted to all those electrons. Benzene is quite a stable molecule as a case so we need a strong electrophile. So species with a positive charge is often necessary. For example of cl + made from a chlorine acid. Nitronium ion. No2 +. Well they exist and are widely used in benzene chemistry. In fact + is reacted with benzene to form trinitrotoluene. Also called dynamite. Very powerful explosive.  ---- Remember the anthem in the benzene being attacked is one of the coffins and these coffins have lots of electrons moving around them.
